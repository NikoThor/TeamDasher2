# DasherDex (PokéDex)
### Team Dasher of Zealand

This is a project where the students had free reign to choose their topic, Team Dasher chose to make their own version of the PokéDex and labelled their project DasherDex to fit with their name.


The source code for the project is located in the 05-Implementation folder, under the src folder while a runnable file can be found under 07-Deployment when it's ready for 'release.'
